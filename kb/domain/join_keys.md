# DataAgentBench Join Key Glossary

Here is how customer IDs and canonical entity identifiers appear differently across DAB datasets and database types. The agent must normalize keys before any cross-database join.

**Rule:** Never assume a primary key in an SQL database maps 1:1 without formatting to a NoSQL document ID. Always run `join_key_resolver.validate_overlap()` before joining.

---

## Yelp Dataset
- **PostgreSQL (`transactions.customer_id`):** Integer (e.g., `12345`)
- **MongoDB (`reviews.customer_id`):** String with `CUST-` prefix (e.g., `"CUST-12345"`)
- **Resolution:** Strip `CUST-` prefix from MongoDB, or format PostgreSQL integers as `f"CUST-{id}"`. Use `join_key_resolver.normalize()`.
- **Overlap expected:** ~95% after normalization. If <90%, check for customers in one system but not the other.

## Support Ticket IDs
- **SQLite (logs):** UUID format (e.g., `"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`)
- **Redshift/DuckDB (analytics):** Truncated hash (e.g., `"550e8400"`)
- **Resolution:** Truncate UUID to first 8 characters, or expand hash to full UUID via lookup table.

## Healthcare Provider IDs
- **PostgreSQL (directory):** Zero-padded string (e.g., `"00456"`)
- **MongoDB (credentialing):** Integer (e.g., `456`) — leading zeros dropped
- **Resolution:** Force string casting on both sides. Never cast to integer — information loss is irreversible. Use `str(id).zfill(5)` for normalization.

## Phone Numbers (CRM Datasets)
- **Source A:** Dashed format (e.g., `"123-456-7890"`)
- **Source B:** E.164 international format (e.g., `"+11234567890"`)
- **Resolution:** Normalize to E.164 using `join_key_resolver.normalize_key(phone, "phone_dashed", "phone_e164")`.

## Product Codes (Retail Datasets)
- **PostgreSQL (catalog):** Alphanumeric SKU (e.g., `"SKU-A1234"`)
- **MongoDB (inventory):** Numeric-only code (e.g., `1234`)
- **Resolution:** Strip alphabetic prefix, compare numeric portion. Validate overlap before joining.

## User/Account IDs (Finance Datasets)
- **PostgreSQL (accounts):** Sequential integer (e.g., `10001`)
- **DuckDB (analytics export):** Hex-encoded hash of the integer (e.g., `"2711"` for `10001`)
- **Resolution:** Convert hex to decimal or decimal to hex before comparison. Validate with sample checks.

## Injection Test
**Q:** "How is CustomerID formatted in the Yelp PostgreSQL database versus the MongoDB reviews collection?"
**Expected:** "PostgreSQL stores customer IDs as integers (e.g., 12345). MongoDB stores them as strings with CUST- prefix (e.g., 'CUST-12345'). Strip CUST- or format integer to match."
**Result:** PASS

# Join Keys

Oracle Forge should assume that shared business or customer identity may be represented differently across databases even when the entities are logically the same.

The strongest verified example in the current repo is the Yelp path:

- MongoDB business metadata uses `business_id` values like `businessid_52`
- DuckDB review rows use `business_ref` values like `businessref_52`

Those values do not match directly. Oracle Forge must normalize them before joining or filtering across sources. In the current implementation, the working Yelp strategy converts `businessid_*` to `businessref_*` before running the DuckDB aggregation.

The general rule for Oracle Forge is:

- never assume raw identifiers align across systems
- inspect format before joining
- document reusable mappings in this KB

This should expand over time into a dataset-by-dataset glossary of join-key transformations.

## Injection Test

Question:
How does Oracle Forge reconcile Yelp business identity across MongoDB and DuckDB in the current verified path?

Expected answer:
It maps MongoDB `business_id` values from the `businessid_*` format to DuckDB `business_ref` values in the `businessref_*` format before aggregation.

Status: pass
